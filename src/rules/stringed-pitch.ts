/**
 * this rule generates the xml info for pitch
 * the linename should give us the <step><alter><octave> information we need to
 * compute the pitch, given that the instrument is stringed.
 * 
 * It should be computed per each fret
 * since this is very simple to do with the help of the resolved-line-name
 * rule, we might want to merge this rule with the stringed-note rule.
